Chapel Public Release Goals (version 1.3.0)
===========================================

The goals of this release are as follows:

* to give the general public an opportunity to see the state and
  evolution of the Chapel implementation first-hand

* to get feedback on the Chapel language and its ongoing
  implementation (please direct to chapel_info@cray.com)

* to demonstrate Chapel's base language features

* to demonstrate Chapel's task parallel features in a multi-threaded,
  multi-locale setting

* to demonstrate Chapel's data parallel features via a combination of

  (i) a multi-threaded implementation of ranges and of non-distributed
      arithmetic, sparse, and associative domains and arrays;

  (ii) a multi-threaded, multi-locale implementation of arithmetic
       domains and arrays via standard Block and Cyclic distributions;

  (iii) a single-threaded, non-distributed reference implementation
        of opaque domains and arrays.
