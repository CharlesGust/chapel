Chapel Compiler Release: README
===============================

This release of the Chapel compiler is intended to give potential
users a look at what we're doing and the opportunity to provide us
with feedback.  See the AGREEMENT file for the release's user
agreement and the LICENSE file for its licensing terms.  Source code
contained within the third-party directory may contain its own
licenses -- see third-party/README for details.



-----------
Quick Start
-----------

1) Load the Chapel module:

     module load chapel


2) Compile an example program using:

     chpl -o hello6-taskpar-dist $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6-taskpar-dist.chpl


3) Execute the resulting executable (on four locales):

     ./hello6-taskpar-dist -nl 4
