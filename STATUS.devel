# This file lists all the existing futures that are categorizes as "bug" or
# "unimplemented feature."
#
# All comments will be stripped out before releasing the final STATUS
#
# To remove comments use: grep -v "^\ *#" STATUS.devel (or 'make STATUS')
#
# To further facilitate generating the final STATUS file, please put the
# names of the future files on a separate line from comments (one future
# per line).  For example:
#
#        # path/to/future/blah.future
#
# If for some reason a .future is omitted prepend the name of the future
# with the 'OMITTED:' and use comments to explain.  For example:
#
#        # OMITTED: path/to/future/blah.future
#        #   b/c it's too difficult to explain
#
# For release 1.3: current to r18669-ish.

General (see also portability section at the bottom of this file)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Some error messages are confusing or unhelpful.
  Workaround: Please ask us for help with interpreting the message.
  # compflags/bradc/badConfigParamOverride.future
  # sparse/bradc/accumInds-forexpr.future
- Compiler and runtime errors don't always report useful line numbers.
  Workaround: Please ask us for help finding the line in question.

  2. Privatized domains and arrays are leaked (i.e., those that use
     the standard distributions).
  3. Data associated with iterators may be leaked.
  4. Data accessed in 'on' and/or 'begin' statements may be leaked.
  Workaround: Use memory tracking facilities (see README.executing).
  Workaround: Please ask us for help with your particular problem.
- The --gdb flag is only supported for single-locale platforms that
  support gdb.

- Bounds checks on index types is not implemented.
- Query expressions on domains and subdomains not supported.
  # domains/vass/domain-arg-query-expr.future
- Array promotion/forall/for/scan expressions always evaluate to 1D arrays.
  E.g., f(A) where A promotes f() should result in an array of type:
    [A.domain] f(A(i)).type but instead results in a 1D array
  E.g., [i in D] f(i) should result in an array of type: [D] f(i).type
    but instead results in a 1D array
  # arrays/bradc/inferArrayType.future

#  b/c it is an issue only with --no-live-analysis
# OMITTED: functions/iterators/diten/arrEltIter.future

Input and Output
----------------
- Binary I/O is not implemented.
- Format control for precision/width is lacking.
  Workaround: see doc/technotes/README.format
- Input of whole arrays is not implemented.
  Workaround: use a loop, e.g., for e in A do read(e);
  # types/file/fileIO.future
- Using 'on' in a writeThis method can lead to a deadlock.
  # multilocale/bradc/needMultiLocales/writeThisUsingOn.future
  # distributions/vass/dmap-writeln-default-value.future


Task Parallelism and Synchronization
------------------------------------
# OMITTED: multilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/test_big_recursive_on.future
#   I think what is wanted here is a multi-plexing tasking layer
# OMITTED: multilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/test_big_recursive_on_begin.future
#   I think what is wanted here is a multi-plexing tasking layer
# OMITTED: parallel/begin/deitz/test_big_recursive_begin.future
#   I think what is wanted here is a multi-plexing tasking layer
- Atomic statements are not implemented.
- Deadlocks may occur due to an insufficient number of threads.
  # multilocale/diten/needMultiLocales/coforallon_maxThreads.future
  # parallel/cobegin/deitz/test_many_threads.future (other issues too)
- Arrays may not be moved to the heap due to begin statements or
  other indirect array element accesses.
  # memory/deitz/test_tricky_heap_case.future


Data Parallelism
----------------
# OMITTED: studies/shootout/nbody/nbody_fullreduction.future
#  b/c not sure how to describe
- Some data parallel statements that should be parallelized are
  serialized with a warning message "X has been serialized".  In some
  case, this can be fixed in the program.
  E.g., Change '+ reduce for i in 1..n do i**2' to
                 '+ reduce forall i in 1..n do i**2' to avoid a
  warning that the reduce has been serialized.  In other cases, this
  is a current limitation:
  1. Scans are always serialized.
  2. Assignments from ranges to multidimensional arrays are always serialized.
  3. Assignment, reductions, and parallel iteration over opaque domains and
     arrays are always serialized.
- Reductions and scans of arrays of arrays may result in errors.
  # arrays/sungeun/array_of_arrays/bxor_reduce.future
  # arrays/sungeun/array_of_arrays/max_reduce.future
  # arrays/sungeun/array_of_arrays/sum_reduce.future
- Reductions zippered arrays of mismatched rank result in a compile time error.
  # arrays/diten/reduce2Dwith3D.future
  # arrays/diten/reduce3Dwith2D.future
- Records in reduction classes may results in out-of-bound indexing
  problems.
  # studies/kmeans/kmeansonepassreduction-mystery.future
- Parallel zippered iteration does not perform runtime size/shape checks
  # arrays/bradc/badParZip.future
  # arrays/claridge/arraySizeMismatch.future
- Whole-domain assignment operations on sparse and associative domains are not all serialized as they should be.
  # domains/sungeun/assoc/minus_equals.future
  # domains/sungeun/sparse/minus_equals.future
  # domains/sungeun/sparse/plus_equals.future


Locales and Domain Maps
-----------------------
- Domain maps may be prematurely freed, resulting in a runtime error
  message.
  Workaround: This may be in the declaration. Try eliding the type.
  # distributions/vass/dmap-var-decl.future
- The default value for locale types is incorrect.
  # types/locale/bradc/defaultLocaleVal.future
  # multilocale/sungeun/locale_default.future
- On statement variable declarations are not yet supported.
  E.g., on Locales(1) var x: real;
  # multilocale/sungeun/on_statement_var_decl.future
- String assignment across locales is by reference rather than value.
  # distributions/bradc/block1Dlocale.future
  # multilocale/diten/needMultiLocales/remoteString3.future
- The local statement is not well supported.  For example, declaring
  domains (whether explicitly via a declaration or implicitly via
  slicing results in a seg fault or non-local access error).  On
  statements should be illegal, but result in local execution.
  # multilocale/local/sungeun/local_privatization.future
  # users/jglewis/locClassSegFault.future


User-Defined Reductions and Scans and User-Defined Domain Maps
--------------------------------------------------------------
- User-defined reductions and scans are not yet implemented.
- User-defined domain maps are not yet implemented.
  # Someone might run into this if they were implementing a domain map
  # distributions/diten/domainMethodNewDist.future


Standard Modules, Standard Distributions, and Standard Layouts
--------------------------------------------------------------
- On some platforms, the Math module is limited by the back-end C compiler.
- Extended precision math functions are not supported.
  # modules/standard/math/figueroa/extended-precision_math_functions.future
- The BlockCyclic distribution is incomplete.
- Reindexing stridable Cyclic is not fully supported.
  # users/jglewis/test_cyclic_dist.future
- Block and Cyclic domains containing indices near the minimum or
  maximum integral type may overflow.
- Array reindexing on some Block, Cyclic, and BlockCyclic arrays is
  not supported.
  # distributions/robust/arithmetic/reindexing/test_strided_reindex3.future
- Array assignment fails for Block distributions with bounding boxes
  that do not overlap with the bounds of the domain.
  # arrays/sungeun/multilocale/weird_bbox_block.future


Miscellaneous
-------------
- Creating many domain types or arrays or tuples types causes the
  compilation time to become unreasonable.
  # arrays/deitz/many/test_many_arrays_of_star_tuples.future
  # arrays/deitz/many/test_many_ranks_of_arithmetic_domains.future
- Default values for formal arguments do not accept conditional
  expressions.
  # functions/deitz/default/test_default_conditional_expr.future

Multi-locale/GASNet executions
------------------------------
- stdin does not work for multi-locale/GASNet executions


Portability
-----------
Cray XE:
- Native conduit not yet supported.  See doc/platform/README.xe-cle
  for details.

Cray XT:
- The memory limit for Chapel programs may need to be set manually.
  See doc/platforms/README.xt-cle for details.

Cray CX1/CX1000:
- Support is only provided using Linux.

PGI compilers (and possibly others):
- Identifiers in the generated code may exceed the back-end compiler's limit.
- Floating point literals of -0.0 may not work as intended.


IEEE floating-point standard conformance:
  The --ieee-float flag is implemented by passing appropriate flags to
  the back-end compiler.  For some compilers, 100% IEEE floating-point
  conformance is not implemented.  In such cases, the --ieee-float
  flag will request the most standard conformant floating-point
  behavior (if such behavior can be identified).
