=============

README.multirealm:

  This traditionally was in doc/release/technotes/README.multirealm;
  in the 1.3 release, PVM wasn't working well for codes that use
  multiple locales/distributions, so we pulled the PVM support for the
  time being, which necessitated pulling the multirealm support for
  the time being as well.  Eventually, we want to resurrect this, but
  need to get PVM working better first.
