\section{Integrating with Other File Systems}\label{s:OFS}

To integrate with other filesystems, the user must modify a couple areas. For
example if we wanted to add Ceph \cite{ceph}, we would need to edit and change the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a plugin {\tt qio\_plugin\_ceph.c} that is placed under {\tt runtime/src/qio/foreignFS/ceph}
\item Add the header file {\tt qio\_plugin\_ceph.h} to {\tt runtime/include/qio}
\item Add a {\tt Makefile.foreignFS-ceph} to {\tt runtime/etc} that will link in what you need at the compile time of the program (this will normally include include and libraries).
\item You will need to add and replicate (renaming appropriately)  the various
makefiles in {\tt runtime/src/qio/foreignFS/hdfs}
\item After this you should be able to make the {\tt ceph} plugin by setting {\tt
CHPL\_FOREIGN\_FS=ceph} and remaking the runtime.
\end{itemize}
