LLVM support is experimental.

To build the compiler with LLVM support:
 source ./util/setchplenv.bash
 export CHPL_LLVM=llvm
 make

Notes:
  -- if you have already built the compiler, you'll need to do a clean
     build in order to get LLVM support. Also, if you have a built llvm in
     third-party/llvm/install, even if you forget to export CHPL_LLVM=llvm,
     the default will be to use the built llvm.

  -- the Makefile in third-party/llvm
     will use svn to download the latest llvm and clang.  We expect this code
     to work with LLVM 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.

To compile a program using the LLVM backend, add --llvm to the chpl command
line. If you pass a --savec directory, the LLVM backend will emit a .bc file in
that directory.

Additionally, if you build your compiler with CHPL_WIDE_POINTERS=node16
and then compile a program with --llvm --llvm-wide-opt --fast, you will
activate communication optimization within LLVM.
