Chapel Runtime Directory Structure and Files
============================================

This directory contains the source code for Chapel's runtime library
routines.  Note that make-ing this directory will only build it for
the current (or inferred) values of $CHPL_COMM and $CHPL_THREADS.
Multiple versions of the runtime can coexist simultaneously, but each
must be explicitly built.

The directory structure of the runtime/ directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile          : Makefile for the runtime
  README            : this file
  etc/              : Makefiles for compiler-generated code
  include/          : header files for the runtime
    comm/           : header files for the runtime's communication layers
    tasks/          : header files for the runtime's tasking layers
    threads/        : header files for the runtime's threading layers
  make/             : Makefiles for the runtime sources
  src/              : source code for the runtime
    comm/           : source code for the runtime's communication layers
    common-chpl/    : Chapel source code for the runtime
    launch/         : source code for Chapel program launchers
    mem/            : source code for memory allocators
    tasks/          : source code for the runtime's tasking layers
    threads/        : source code for the runtime's threading layers
    timers/         : source code for timers
