\sekshun{Domains}
\label{Domains}
\index{domains}

A \emph{domain} is a first-class representation of an index set.
Domains are used to specify iteration spaces, to define the size and
shape of arrays (\rsec{Arrays}), and to specify aggregate operations
like slicing.  The indices described by a domain may be regular and
structured or they may be irregular and unstructured.  Chapel also
supports the ability to create simple \emph{subdomains} and \emph{sparse
subdomains} to represent subsets of a domain's index set.  A domain's
indices may potentially be distributed across multiple locales as
described in~\rsec{Domain_Maps}, supporting global-view data
structures.

\subsection{Domain Overview}

There are three \emph{kinds} of domain, distinguished by their subset
dependencies: \emph{base domains}, \emph{subdomains} and \emph{sparse
subdomains}.  Base domains create complete index sets.  Subdomains create index
sets which are a subset of the indices in a base domain or another subdomain.
Sparse subdomains are subdomains which can represent sparse index subsets
efficiently. These relationships can be represented as follows:

\begin{syntax}
domain-type:
  base-domain-type
  subdomain-type

subdomain-type:
  simple-subdomain-type
  sparse-subdomain-type
\end{syntax}

Domains can be further classified according to whether they are \emph{regular}
or \emph{irregular}.  Regular domains include contiguous and strided rectangular
domains.  Irregular domains include the \emph{associative} domain types as well
as sparse subdomains of regular domains.  

An irregular domain can store an arbitrary set of indices of an
arbitrary but homogenous index type.  Irregular domains typically
require space proportional to the number of indices being
represented.

Practically, regular and irregular
domains are distinguished by their layout: regular domains can be summarized
using ranges, while irregular domains contain an explicit entry for each
possible index value.  An index set can be either \emph{ordered} or \emph{unordered},
depending on whether its members have a well-defined order defined upon them.

The type of a domain describes how a domain is represented, while its value is
the set of indices it represents.
In addition to storing a value, each domain variable has an identity that
distinguishes them from other domains that may have the same type and
value.  This identity is used to define the domain's relationship
with subdomains, index types~(\rsec{Index_Types}),
and arrays~(\rsec{Association_of_Arrays_to_Domains}).  The identity of
a domain is represented by its name.

\begin{openissue}
In the future, it is likely that we will support a means of creating
domain aliases, much as we support array aliases currently.
\end{openissue}

In the next section (\rsec{Base_Domains}) we discuss the types and values
that can be associated with a base domain.  In~\rsec{Subdomains}, we discuss the
types and values of 
simple subdomains that can be created from those base domains.
In~\rsec{Sparse_Subdomains}, we discuss the types and values of sparse
subdomains.  The remainder of this chapter describes the important
manipulations that can be perfomed with domains, as well as the built-in
operators and functions defined for domains.


\subsection{Base Domains}
\label{Base_Domains}
\index{domains!base}

Base domain types can be classified as regular or irregular.  Contiguous and
strided rectangular domains are currently the only supported regular domains.
Irregular base domain types are all associative domain types.  Associative
domain types consist of normal, enumerated and opaque associative domain types.

\begin{syntax}
base-domain-type:
  rectangular-domain-type
  associative-domain-type
\end{syntax}

All of these base domain types are discussed in turn in the following
subsections.

\subsubsection{Rectangular Domains}

Rectangular domains describe
multidimensional rectangular index sets.  They are characterized by a
tensor product of ranges and represent indices that are tuples of an
integral type.  Because their index sets can be represented using ranges,
regular domain values occupy $O(1)$ space.
They are useful for representing multidimensional rectangular index
sets and arrays.

\paragraph{Rectangular Domain Types}
\index{rectangular domains!types}
\index{types!rectangular domains}

Rectangular domain types are parameterized by three things:
\begin{itemize}
\item \chpl{rank}, a positive \chpl{int} value indicating the number
of dimensions that the domain represents;
\item \chpl{idxType}, a type member representing the index type for
each dimension.  If unspecified, \chpl{idxType} defaults
to \chpl{int}.
% BLC: we should potentially rename idxType to idxDimType to make it
% more consistent with the irregular case
\item \chpl{stridable}, a \chpl{bool} value indicating whether
any of the domain's dimensions will be characterized by a strided
range.  If unspecified, \chpl{stridable} defaults to \chpl{false}.
\end{itemize}

If \chpl{rank} is $1$, the index type represented by a rectangular
domain is \chpl{idxType}.  Otherwise, the index type is the homogenous
tuple type \chpl{rank*idxType}.

% BLC: longer-term, we've talked about potentially making it be
% rank*idxType even if rank is 1.

The syntax of a rectangular domain type is summarized as follows:

\begin{syntax}
rectangular-domain-type:
  `domain' ( named-expression-list )
\end{syntax}

\noindent where \sntx{named-expression-list} permits the values of
\chpl{rank}, \chpl{idxType}, and \chpl{stridable} to be specified
using standard function call syntax.

%\begin{example}
%
% PLACEHOLDER: INSERT EXAMPLE HERE
%
%\end{example}

\paragraph{Rectangular Domain Values}
\label{Rectangular_Domain_Values}
\index{rectangular domains!values}
\index{domains!values!rectangular}

A rectangular domain's value is represented as \chpl{rank} ranges of
type \chpl{range(idxType,} \chpl{ BoundedRangeType.bounded,} \chpl{
stridable)}.  The index set for a rank~1 domain is the set of indices
described by its singleton range.  The index set for a rank~$n$
domain is the set of all \chpl{n*idxType} tuples described by the
tensor product of its ranges.  Rectangular domain indices are ordered
according to the lexicographic order of their values.

\index{rectangular domains!literals}
\index{domains!rectangular!literals}

Literal rectangular domain values are represented by a comma-separated
list of range expressions of matching \chpl{idxType} enclosed in
square brackets:

%
% TODO: Is it correct that they must be matching?
%

\begin{syntax}
domain-literal:
  [ range-expression-list ]

range-expression-list:
  range-expression
  range-expression, range-expression-list

range-expression:
  expression
\end{syntax}

\noindent The type of a rectangular domain literal is defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \chpl{rank} = the number of range expressions in the literal
\item \chpl{idxType} = the type of the range expressions
\item \chpl{stridable} = \chpl{true} if any of the range expressions
are stridable, otherwise \chpl{false}
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
The expression \chpl{[1..5, 1..5]} defines a rectangular domain with
type \chpl{domain(rank=2,} \chpl{ idxType=int,} \chpl{ strided=false)}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The expression \chpl{[1..5, 1..5]} defines a $5 \times 5$ rectangular
domain with the indices $(1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, 5), (2, 1), \ldots (5, 5)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
In the code
\begin{chapel}
var D: domain(2) = [1..n, 1..n];
\end{chapel}

\chpl{D} is defined as a two-dimensional, nonstridable rectangular
domain with an index type of \chpl{2*int} and is initialized to
contain the set of indices $(i,j)$ for all $i$ and $j$ such that
$i \in {1, 2, \ldots, n}$ and $j \in {1, 2, \ldots, n}$.
\end{example}

\index{rectangular domains!default value}
\index{domains!rectangular!default value}

The default value of a range type is the \chpl{rank} default range
values for type \chpl{range(idxType, BoundedRangeType.bounded, stridable)}.

% TODO: example here

\subsubsection{Associative Domains}

Associative domains represent an arbitrary set of indices
of a given type and can be used to describe sets or to create
dictionary-style arrays.  Opaque domains are those for which the
indices have no inherent names and are therefore anonymous.  They can
be used for representing sets and for building unstructured arrays,
similar to pointer-based data structures in conventional languages.

\paragraph{Associative Domain Types}

\label{Associative_Domain_Types}
\index{types!associative domains}
\index{associative domains!types}

An associative domain type is parameterized by \chpl{idxType}, the
type of the index that it stores.  The syntax is as follows:

\begin{syntax}
associative-domain-type:
  normal-associative-domain-type
  enumerated-domain-type
  opaque-domain-type

normal-associative-domain-type:
  `domain' ( associative-index-type )

enumerated-domain-type:
  `domain' ( enumerated-type-name )

opaque-domain-type:
  `domain' ( `opaque' )

associative-index-type:
  identifier

enumerated-type-name:
  identifier
\end{syntax}

%
% should there be an opt_idxTypeEquals in the domain type above?
%
Normal associative domains have an index set whose members are of the
associative index type.  Enumerated domains are a special case, in which
the \sntx{associative-index-type} is an enumerated type.  Enumerated types are
handled specially during initialization, as described below.
\index{types!opaque domains}
\index{opaque domains!types}
\index{domains!opaque}
Opaque domain types are parameterized by the type \chpl{opaque},
indicating that the index values are anonymous and have no obvious
representational name or value.  

\paragraph{Associative Domain Values}
\label{Associative_Domain_Values}
\index{associative domains!values}
\index{domains!associative!values}

An associative domain's value is simply the set of all index values
that the domain describes.  The indices of an associative domain are
typically unordered.  

\index{associative domains!literals, lack thereof}
\index{associative domains!initializations}

There is no literal syntax for an associative domain, though a tuple
of values of type \chpl{idxType} can be used to initialize a variable
of associative domain type.

% TODO: assign too?

\index{associative domains!default values}

The default value for a normal associative domain is the empty set.

\subparagraph{Enumerated Domain Values}

Associative domains over
enumerated types are ordered according to the order in which the
enumeration's identifiers were declared.

Being a special case of associative domains, an enumerated domain can be
initialized by tuple of enumerators.  All of the enumerators must be
members of the enumeration type used to declare the domain.

\index{associative domains!default values}

The default value for an enumerated domain is the set of all identifiers in the
enumeration.

\begin{rationale}

The decision to have enumerated domains start fully populated was
based on the observation that enumerations have a finite, typically
small number of elements and that it would be common to declare arrays
with values corresponding to each identifier in the enumeration.
Further, in terms of usability it is simpler to clear a fully-populated
domain than to fully populate an empty one.

In addition, fully-populated constant enumerated
domains are an important case for compiler optimizations, particularly
if the numeric values of the enumeration are consecutive.

\end{rationale}

\subparagraph{Opaque Domain Values}
\index{opaque domains!values}
\index{domains!opaque!values}

An opaque domain's value is simply the unordered set of anonymous
indices that the domain describes.

\index{opaque domains!literals, lack thereof}
\index{domains!opaque!literals}

There is no literal syntax for an opaque domain due to the fact that
the indices have no inherent names.

\index{opaque domains!default values}

The default value for an opaque domain is the empty set.


\subsection{Subdomains}
\label{Subdomains}

A subdomain is a domain whose indices are guaranteed to be a subset of
those described by another domain known as its \emph{parent domain}.
Subdomains have the same type as their parent domain, and by default
they inherit the domain map of their parent domain.  All domain types
support subdomains.

\begin{rationale}
Subdomains are provided in Chapel for a number of reasons: to
facilitate the ability of the compiler or a reader to reason about the
inter-relationship of distinct domain variables; to support the
author's ability to omit redundant domain mapping specifications; to
support the compiler's ability to reason about the relative alignment
of multiple domains; and to improve the compiler's ability to prove
away bounds checks for array accesses.
\end{rationale}

\subsubsection{Subdomain Types}
\label{Subdomain_Types}
\index{subdomains!types}
\index{types!subdomains}

A simple subdomain type is specified using the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
simple-subdomain-type:
  `subdomain' ( domain-expression )
\end{syntax}

This declares that \sntx{domain-expression} is the parent domain of
this subdomain type.  The subdomain type has the same type as its
parent domain.  By default it will share the parent domain's domain
map.  A simple subdomain specifies a subdomain
with the same underlying representation as its base domain.  

\begin{openissue}

An open semantic issue for subdomains is when a subdomain's subset
property should be re-verified when its parent domain is reassigned
and whether this should be done aggressively or lazily.

\end{openissue}


\subsection{Sparse Subdomains}
\label{Sparse_Subdomains}
\index{domains!sparse}
\index{subdomains!sparse}

\begin{syntax}
sparse-subdomain-type:
  `sparse' `subdomain'[OPT] ( domain-expression )
\end{syntax}

This declaration creates a sparse subdomain.
 \emph{Sparse subdomains} are irregular domains that describe an
arbitrary subset of a domain, even if the parent domain is a regular
domain.  Sparse subdomains are useful in Chapel for
defining \emph{sparse arrays} in which a single element value occurs
frequently enough that it is worthwhile to avoid storing it
redundantly.  The difference between a sparse subdomain's index set
and its parent domain's describes the set of indices for which the
sparse array will store this replicated value.
See~\rsec{Sparse_Arrays} for details about sparse arrays.

\subsubsection{Sparse Domain Types}
\index{sparse domains!values}

Each root domain type has a unique corresponding sparse subdomain
type.  Sparse subdomains whose parent domains are also sparse
subdomains share the same type.

\subsubsection{Sparse Domain Values}
\label{Sparse_Domain_Values}
\index{sparse domains!values}

A sparse subdomain's value is simply the set of all index values that
the domain describes.  If the parent domain's indices were ordered,
the sparse subdomain's are as well.

\index{sparse domains!literals, lack thereof}
\index{sparse domains!initializations}
There is no literal syntax for an associative domain, though for a
domain \chpl{D}, a tuple of values of type \chpl{index(D)} can be used
to initialize a variable of sparse domain type.

\index{sparse domains!default value}
The default value for a sparse subdomain value is the empty set.

\begin{example}
The following code declares a two-dimensional dense domain \chpl{D},
followed by a two dimensional sparse subdomain of \chpl{D}
named \chpl{SpsD}.  Since \chpl{SpsD} is uninitialized, it will
initially describe the empty set of indices from \chpl{D}.
\begin{chapel}
const D: domain(2) = [1..n, 1..n];
var SpsD: sparse subdomain(D);
\end{chapel}
\end{example}


\subsection{Iteration over Domains}
\label{Iteration_over_Domains}
\index{domains!iteration}

All domains support iteration via standard for, forall, and coforall
loops.  These loops iterate over all of the indices that the domain
describes.  The type of the iterator variable for an iteration over a
domain named \chpl{D} is that domain's index type, \chpl{index(D)}.
If the domain's indices are ordered, a for loop will traverse the
indices in order.


\subsection{Domain Operations}

Chapel supplies built-in operators and functions that can be used to manipulate
domains.  Unless otherwise noted, these operations are applicable to a domain of
any type, whether a base domain or a subdomain.

\subsubsection{Domain Assignment}
\label{Domain_Assignment}
\index{domains!assignment}

All domain types support domain assignment.  Domain assignment is by
value and causes the target domain variable to take on the index set
of the right-hand side expression.  In practice, the right-hand side
expression is often another domain value; a tuple of ranges (for
regular domains); or a tuple of indices or a loop that enumerates
indices (for irregular domains).  If the domain variable being
assigned was used to declare arrays, these arrays are reallocated as
discussed in~\rsec{Association_of_Arrays_to_Domains}.

\begin{example}
The following three assignments show ways of assigning indices to a
sparse domain, \chpl{SpsD}.  The first assigns the domain two index
values, \chpl{(1,1)} and \chpl{(n,n)}.  The second assigns the domain
all of the indices along the diagonal from
\chpl{(1,1)}$\ldots$\chpl{(n,n)}.  The third invokes an iterator that
is written to \chpl{yield} indices read from a file named
``inds.dat''.  Each of these assignments has the effect of replacing
the previous index set with a completely new set of values.
\begin{chapel}
SpsD = ((1,1), (n,n));
SpsD = [i in 1..n] (i,i);
SpsD = readIndicesFromFile("inds.dat");
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Domain Slicing}
\label{Domain_Slicing}
\index{slicing!domains}
\index{domains!slicing}

In Chapel, slicing is the application of an index set to another
variable using either parentheses or square brackets.

% TODO: syntax diagram?!?

\paragraph{Domain-based Slicing}
\index{slicing!domains}
\index{domains!slicing}

The index set used to express a slice can be represented using a
domain value.

Slicing an array results in an alias to a subset of the array's
elements as described in~\rsec{Array_Slicing}.

Slicing a domain evaluates to a new domain value whose index set is
the intersection of the domain's index set and the slicing index set.
The type and domain map of the result match the domain being sliced.

%
% TODO: can we say that it is an alias in the case of sparse/associative?
%

\paragraph{Range-based Slicing}
\label{Range_Based_Slicing}
\index{slicing!range-based}
\index{range-based slicing}
When slicing rectangular domains or arrays, the slice can be expressed
as a list of \chpl{rank} ranges.  These ranges can either be bounded
or unbounded.  When unbounded, they inherit their bounds from the
domain or array being sliced.

\begin{example}
The following code declares a two dimensional rectangular
domain \chpl{D}, and then a number of subdomains of \chpl{D} by
slicing into \chpl{D} using bounded and unbounded ranges.
The \chpl{InnerD} domain describes the inner indices of
D, \chpl{Col2OfD} describes the 2nd column of
\chpl{D}, and \chpl{AllButLastRow} describes all of \chpl{D} except
for the last row.

\begin{chapel}
const D: domain(2) = [1..n, 1..n],
      InnerD = D[2..n-1, 2..n-1],
      Col2OfD = D[.., 2..2],
      AllButLastRow = D[..n-1, ..];
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

\begin{openissue}
For slices that use a list of ranges, our intention is to use zipper
semantics vs. tensor semantics when evaluating the ranges depending on
whether square brackets or parentheses are used.  Currently all slices
are defined using tensor semantics for simplicity.  Since this may
change in the future, we recommend using square brackets to express
array-based slicing.
\end{openissue}

\paragraph{Rank-Change Slicing}
\label{Rank_Change_Slicing}
\index{slicing!rank-change}
\index{rank-change slicing}

For multidimensional rectangular domains and arrays, substituting
integral values for one or more of the ranges in a range-based slice
will result in domain or array of lower rank.

The result of a rank-change slice on an array is an alias to a subset
of the array's elements as described
in~\rsec{Rectangular_Array_Slicing}.

The result of rank-change slice on a domain is a subdomain of the
domain being sliced, as described in~\rsec{Subdomains}.  The resulting
subdomain's type will be the same as the original domain, but with
a \chpl{rank} equal to the number of dimensions that were sliced by
ranges rather than integers.

\subsubsection{Domain Striding}
\label{Domain_Striding}
\index{domains!striding}
\index{by@\chpl{by}!on rectangular domains}

The \chpl{by} operator can be applied to a rectangular domain value in
order to create a strided rectangular domain value.  The right-hand
operand to the \chpl{by} operator can either be an integral value or
an integral tuple whose size matches the domain's rank.

% syntax diagram?

The type of the resulting domain is the same as the original domain
but with \chpl{stridable} set to true.  In the case of an integer
stride value, the value of the resulting domain is computed by
applying the integer value to each range in the value using the
\chpl{by} operator.  In the case of a tuple stride value, the resulting
domain's value is computed by applying each tuple component to the
corresponding range using the \chpl{by} operator.


\subsubsection{Domain Index Type Extraction}
\label{Index_Types}
\index{domains!index types}

Each domain value has a corresponding compiler-provided \emph{index
type} which can be used to represent values belonging to that domain's
index set.  Index types are described using the following syntax:

\begin{syntax}
index-type:
  `index' ( domain-expression )
\end{syntax}

\begin{rationale}

Index types are included in Chapel with two goals in mind. The first
is to improve readability of the Chapel program by declaring variables
to be members of specific domains with the intention of giving them
more semantic meaning to a reader as compared to, say, storing all
indices as \chpl{int} types where the semantic meanings blur.

The second goal is to provide the compiler with the ability to prove
away bounds checks by giving the user the capability to assure the
compiler that a given variable belongs to a particular domain and is
therefore in bounds for its arrays and its parent domains' arrays.

Since index types are known to be legal for a given domain, they may
also afford the opportunity to represent an index using an optimized
format that doesn't simply store the index variable's value in order
to support accelerated access to arrays declared over that domain.
For both this reason and the previous, it may be less expensive to
index into arrays using index type variables of their domains or
subdomains.

\end{rationale}

\begin{openissue}

An open issue for index types is what the semantics should be for an
index type value that is live across a modification to its domain's
index set---particularly one that shrinks the index set.  Our
hypothesis is that most stored indices will either have short
lifespans or belong to constant or monotonically growing domains.  But
these semantics need to be defined nevertheless.

\end{openissue}

\subsubsection{Domain Index Set Membership}
\label{Domain_Membership}
\index{domains!membership}

Every domain type supports a \chpl{member(i)} method that returns a
boolean value indicating whether or not the given index \chpl{i} is a
member of the domain's index set.

%
% would like to call the type of i above idxType, but it's not true
% for rectangular...  motivation to unify
%

\subsubsection{Clearing a Domain's Index Set}
\label{Clearing_Domain_Indices}
\index{domains!clearing}

Every domain type supports a \chpl{clear()} method that resets a
domain's index set to its default value as specified
in the corresponding Default Values subsection.

\begin{example}
The following call will cause the sparse domain \chpl{SpsD} to
describe an empty set of indices as it was when initially declared.
\begin{chapel}
SpsD.clear();
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The following call causes the associative domain \chpl{HashD} to
describe an empty set of indices as it did when it was initially
declared.
\begin{chapel}
HashD.clear();
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Adding and Removing Domain Indices}
\label{Adding_and_Removing_Domain_Indices}
\index{domains!adding indices}
\index{domains!removing indices}

All irregular domain types support the ability to incrementally add
and remove indices from their index sets.  This can either be done
using \chpl{add(i:idxType)} and \chpl{remove(i:idxType)} methods on a
domain variable or by using the \chpl{+=} and \chpl{-=} assignment
operators.  It is legal to add the same index to an irregular domain's
index set twice, but illegal to remove an index that does not belong
to the domain's index set.

%
% These remove semantics seem dangerous in a parallel context; maybe
% add flags to both the method versions of the call that say whether
% they should balk or not?  Or add exceptions...
%

As with normal domain assignments, arrays declared in terms of a
domain being modified in this way will be reallocated as discussed
in~\rsec{Association_of_Arrays_to_Domains}.


\subsection{Domain Arguments}
\label{Domain_Arguments}
\index{domains!function arguments}
\index{function arguments!domains}

This section describes the semantics of passing domains as arguments
to functions.

\subsubsection{Formal Arguments of Domain Type}

When a domain value is passed to a formal argument of compatible
domain type by blank intent, it is passed by reference in order to
preserve the domain's identity.

% Need some syntax diagrams here maybe?


\subsubsection{Domain Promotion of Scalar Functions}
\label{Domain_Promotion_of_Scalar_Functions}
\index{domains!promotion}

Domain values may be passed to a scalar function argument whose type
matches the domain's index type.  This results in a promotion of the
scalar function as defined in~\rsec{Promotion}.

\begin{example}
Given a function \chpl{foo()} that accepts real floating point values
and an associative domain \chpl{D} of
type \chpl{domain(real)}, \chpl{foo} can be called with \chpl{D} as
its actual argument which will result in the function being invoked
for each value in the index set of \chpl{D}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Given an array \chpl{A} with element type \chpl{int} declared over a
one-dimensional domain \chpl{D} with \chpl{idxType} \chpl{int}, the
array elements can be assigned their corresponding index values by
writing:
\begin{chapel}
A = D;
\end{chapel}
This is equivalent to:
\begin{chapel}
forall (a,i) in (A,D) do
  a = i;
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

Returns the low index of the domain as a value of the domain's index
type.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.high: index($Domain$)
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the high index of the domain as a value of the domain's index
type.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.stride: int(numBits(idxType)) where rank == 1
proc $Domain$.stride: rank*int(numBits(idxType))
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the stride of the domain as the domain's stride type (for 1D
domains) or a tuple of the domain's stride type (for multidimensional
domains).
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.translate(off: integral): domain
proc $Domain$.translate(off: rank*integral): domain
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a new domain that is the current domain translated
by \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} for each dimension \chpl{d}.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.expand(off: integral): domain
proc $Domain$.expand(off: rank*integral): domain
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a new domain that is the current domain expanded in
dimension \chpl{d} if \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} is positive or
contracted in dimension \chpl{d} if \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} is
negative.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.exterior(off: integral): domain
proc $Domain$.exterior(off: rank*integral): domain
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a new domain that is the exterior portion of the current
domain with \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} indices for each
dimension \chpl{d}.  If \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} is negative,
compute the exterior from the low bound of the dimension; if positive,
compute the exterior from the high bound.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
proc $Domain$.interior(off: integral): domain
proc $Domain$.interior(off: rank*integral): domain
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a new domain that is the interior portion of the current
domain with \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} indices for each
dimension \chpl{d}.  If \chpl{off} or \chpl{off(d)} is negative,
compute the interior from the low bound of the dimension; if positive,
compute the interior from the high bound.
