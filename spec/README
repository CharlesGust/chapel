Each chapter on a feature (e.g. a data type) should have this structure:

* The first one or a couple of paragraphs are a high-level introduction
and/or summary of the feature. It could include, for example:

  - compare and/or contrast this feature in Chapel vs. other languages,
  - give insights into how the compiler uses the feature(s).

* The next paragraph is the road map, stating the organization of
the chapter and/or how the feature is presented in the spec.

* The first section is optional and contains a more in-depth
introduction of the feature.

* For a data type, these sections should follow:

  - types
  - values, with subsections on
      - literals
         - specify the literal's type first, the literal's value second
      - default values
  - common operations - all of the following that applies:
      - the assignment statement
      - equality and other comparisons
      - iterating
      - implicit/explicit conversions?
      - printing behavior?

* Then a section describing operations specific to this feature follows.


The following environments are available for use in the spec:

- example    
  Example Chapel programs, along with explanation text
  should be contained in the example environment.

- note
  To make a note to future implementors of Chapel, or those
  who are interested in how Chapel is implemented, use the note
  environment.  

- rationale
  To provide more explanation about a feature, use the rationale
  section.   

- openissue
    Issues that we do not know how to handle.

- future
    Issues or features that we have a story about, but which are not yet
  fully-designed or have not yet been implemented. 


Guidelines for updating the spec:

- There should be example programs for every language concept
  and for every subsection.

- In explaining a feature, try to address both the compiler
  developers and programmers of the language.  Explain the syntax of
  the feature and any implementation details.  Also explain the
  impact of the feature and how it is used when programming.

[Some general principles highlighted by the spec review 8/10/2010:]

- Group material into chapters by theme.
  - It is OK to move syntax for a feature (e.g. class types)
    from the chapter on the enclosing syntactic concept (e.g. type)
    into the chapter on the enclosing theme (e.g. classes).

- Implementation limitations go into the status file for the release.

- Use examples in lieu of a user's guide/gentle introduction.

- Italicize the term when you are defining it.
  Be sure to add it to the index.  We want as many things as possible in
  the index.
