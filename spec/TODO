Classes
-------
* add destructors description

Expressions
-----------
* move most of 10.5 into chapter 13 and replace with a forward
  reference to the appropriate section of 13 (see
  domains/ranges/classes/records for the precedent)

* promote 10.5.1 and 10.5.2 (index expressions and member access
  expressions) to top-level sections in chapter 10

* the index expressions section should also have a pointer to the
  section that defines 'this' functions (wherever that is)

* add a syntax production for index-expressions that duplicates the
  logic of call-expressions


Ranges
------
* should we define ranges/domains as being array-like where the
  indices serve as both indices and values?  (for the purposes of
  slicing, e.g.)


Functions
---------
* move oveloading and resolution subsections to the end of the section
  *** this should be true after first class function stuff is removed.
* define semantics of creating tuples with array components, etc.


Domains and Arrays
------------------

* clarify distinction between sparse domains and associative domains
  of integers?

* summary implies that an associative domain is the same thing as a
  domain?

* better example of promotion than domain assignment of domain to
  array?  (see mail with Michael Ferguson)

* better array slicing example (see mail with Michael Ferguson)

* note that array slicing doesn't result in a renumbering of the array
  -- global indices are preserved -- contrasts with Perl, Python


* zippered vs. tensor indexing

TODOs from email:

- last sentence of 23.3.1 : "If there are conflicting distributions"
  This should be narrowed to only apply to zippered products I
  believe.

- in Sort module, add definition that < is used to do the sort.


Generics
--------
* add mention of the new 'depth' argument for compilerWarning/Error


TODOs while updating the CHANGES file
-------------------------------------
* document the Containers module
-------------------------------------

* Make supported parameter and type queries for ranges, domains, and
  arrays more explicit in the spec.  Most users are only realizing
  that this is possible by reading example codes.  Maybe include as
  part of the "supported functions" sections for these concepts?

* page 100: 1D arrays can be indexed with square brackets or parens;
  shouldn't any rank array be indexable with either?

This may be stated as is because A(1..3, 1..3) would currently return
the 2D slice rather than a 1D array whereas A[1..3, 1..3] returns the
same thing but it is correct in that case.  This is because we don't
use promotion to implement this (and we shouldn't) but that means the
square brackets are currently ignored.  I didn't make any changes here
yet.

* refactor/rewrite domain/array chapter (Brad)

* add description of local block

Is this a good idea?  I don't understand the semantic guarantees we
can make for this construct in the presence of optimizations...

* describe how to specify a homogenous varargs type (e.g., x: int...n)?

These are orthogonal.  I added an example.

* add const intents to spec and define blank intents in terms of const
  intents (and "by reference" for arrays/domains):

  Steve's definition of const intents:
  - scalars: copy in and disallow modification
  - classes: copy reference in and disallow modification to reference
  - records: copy in and disallow modification
  - domains/arrays: pass by ref and disallow modification

  Brad's mental definition had been the same except:
  - records: pass by ref and disallow modification

  Joint definition of blank intents:
  - scalars, classes, records: same as blank:
  - domains/arrays: pass by ref and allow modification

* Does spec talk about declaring methods for types other than
  classes/records?

* Document +, - on domains

* do we document that argument names must match for dynamic dispatch to apply?

* did we document the instantiation point of functions that are only
  instantiated via dynamic dispatch (14070)

From meeting when David was here Sep 2008
=========================================
