Suggested TODO for Sung's week:

2) Look into nondeterministic SIGABRT issue with gasnet-fast on
   test/release/examples/ra*.chpl which seem new to me.

3) I think you're already on the SSCA2_commDiags question


=========================================================
Problems analyzed and assigned that should be fixed soon:
=========================================================

studies/ssca2/performance/SSCA2_commDiags (sungeun)
---------------------------------------------------

  linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads-std (2012-10-02) Sung
  has this one.  It looks to me (gbt) like the comm diags ranges just
  need to be wider.  (sungeun: 10/22/12) It's actually bounded for
  certain operations, so I'm still working on it in the background.


==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

SIGABRT on gasnet-fast runs (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------
release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/ra (compopts: 1) (10/13/12)
mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large (10/11/12, 10/21/12)
ra-atomics (UNASSIGNED) (10/11/12)

SSCA2_main (UNASSIGNED)
-----------------------y
Periodically times out for PGI (alternates between time out and stack
overflow error documented in REGRESSIONS)


ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg improved the verification loops using syncs to avoid losing data,
but occasional failures continued.

New information (10/3/12): the "random" indices are strongly skewed toward
the bottom of the index range (1/4th of the table updates are to the 0'th
element), which makes conflicting updates far more common than they should
be.  Sung reports that the official HPCC RA changed its random number
generator for this reason -- we should look into converting Chapel to use
the same algorithm (or to permit a selection between both).
  release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/variants/ra-cleanloop: fixed by r20326
  studies/hpcc/2008/ra: not fixed yet, failed 8/14/12
  studies/hpcc/nodistrib/ra.nodist: should have been fixed by 20333 (8/14/12),
    not fixed yet, failed 8/18/12, 9/{16,17,21,30}/12.
  studies/hpcc/RA/bradc/parallel/ra-dist: not fixed yet, last failure unknown

lulesh (bradc)
--------------
Times out sometimes in XMT testing, but seems to have stabilized in
other cases.

TooManyThreads (unassigned)
---------------------------
Fails periodically.  Lately observed pthreads.tcmalloc (2012/08/15).

mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Succeeded: 9/23 (64ggffpd)
  Failed: 10/4 (linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc)
  Failed (SIGABRT): 10/11/12 (")


linux64.gnu.none.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
[Error: Timed out executing program release/examples/spec/Task_Parallelism_and_Synchronization/syncCounter] (10/18/12)

linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
sungeun: 10/18/12.  Things seem quieter, but not perfect
- Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16, stream-ep 8/23/12)
- Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13)
-  seg fault during program execution (same as as previous):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)
- Intermitent time outs:
  [Error: Timed out executing program release/examples/spec/Task_Parallelism_and_Synchronization/syncCounter] (10/18/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/slicing/test_array_slicing3] (10/17/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array] (10/18/12)


baseline (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
[Error: Timed out executing program optimizations/bulkcomm/asenjo/stencilDR/v2/stencil] (10/17/12, normally fails)



studies/shootout/mandelbrot/mandelbrot-fancy (10/12/12)
-------------------------------------------------------
gets incorrect answer using --baseline; sometimes times out

valgrind (sungeun)
------------------
sungeun (10/16/2012): I believe the non-determinism from valgrind
errors is now resolved (still have timeouts).

xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.

compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.


=========================================
Not so noisy as to be familiar annoyances
=========================================

studies/dijkstra/driverEdgeBtw

(03/12/11, 9/14/12) Also documented in REGRESSIONS file.

===========================================
Not noisy, but need some attention sometime
===========================================

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.

xt-cle.cray-xt-cray.none.fifo.pthreads
--------------------------------------
The following compiler segfaults(?) appeared only once on 9/28/12
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/primers/opaque]
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/spec/Generics/fillTuple2]
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/spec/Iterators/as-arrays]
