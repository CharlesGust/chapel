==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

distributions/robust/arithmetic/performance/alloc_all (sungeun)
---------------------------------------------------------------
This started failing on 6/26. It's Sung's and she's going to fix it, but
hasn't gotten to it yet.


spectralnorm (vass)
-------------------
proposed approach is to see whether reference version is similarly
noisy, and if not to see whether ours has inadvertant nondeterminisms.


madness (sungeun)
-----------------
Sung's been working on dialing down parallelism to avoid timeouts
in oversubscribed setting, but it's not yet perfect: test_likepy
timed out 06/05/12


ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg plans to remove races from the verification loop on the theory
that if we're barely/occasionally failing, removing errors introduced
due to races here should take us below the threshold.


lulesh (bradc)
--------------
1) Brad made changes this week that should stabilize Sung's version of
   lulesh
2) there are likely still timeouts on the release version that should
   be investigated.
3) causes an internal error in xmt (though perhaps not a noisy one?)


cray-xt-cray (UNASSIGNED)
-------------------------
When the Chapel compiler is built with cray-xt-cray, we get
nondeterministic failures that have not been investigated.  One
question would be whether turning optimizations off/down when building
'chpl' would make these go away.


linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
1) Continue to have a lot of noise in testing.
   Often the execution times out nondeterministically
   - is that due to gasnet (see below) ?
2) Some comm counts off, got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16)


valgrind (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
1) Nondeterministic "the impossible has happened" failures
2) Nondeterministic timeouts (could raise timeout value even further)


xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.


variance in comm counts - linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads (sungeun)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
examples:
 performance/sungeun/multilocale/syncsingle  (06/17/12, 6/21)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/performance/reduce*


parallel/cobegin/diten/cobeginRace (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------
"timedexec died with signal 11" - pgi compiler (06/18/12)
unknown cause - baseline (06/17/12)


non-deterministic timeouts with gasnet (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------------
The following configurations are affected:
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.fifo.pthreads.tcmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads
examples of what times out:
 release/examples/benchmarks/ssca2/SSCA2_main
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi
 distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort
 etc.


"in routine alloca() there is a stack overflow" under PGI (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhat? nondeterministic.
These configurations:
 linux64.pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads--linux64.gnu


==================================================
Not so noisy as to be instantly recognizable (yet)
==================================================

gasnet-everything nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------
MultiBlockDist2DLocales (06/05/12, 6/16)
test_module_Sort (06/06/12, 6/16)
test_array_slicing3 (06/08/12, 6/16)


no-local nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
-------------------------------------
cg-sparse-timecomp (06/05/12)


memory/vass/crash-memory-module-1 (vass)
----------------------------------------
fails intermittently


======================================================
Older stuff that I didn't see creating noise this week
======================================================

============================================================
linux64.pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
============================================================
This seems noisy, or not yet ready for primetime.  Add to REGRESSIONS?
[Error matching program output for studies/lulesh/sungeun/lulesh (compopts: 1)]
Newly added this week, but fails also for the standard implementation. Add to REGRESSIONS.
[Error matching program output for studies/ssca2/vass/SSCA2_main (compopts: 1, execopts: 1)]
[Error matching program output for studies/ssca2/vass/SSCA2_main (compopts: 2, execopts: 1)]
[Error matching program output for studies/ssca2/vass/SSCA2_main (compopts: 3, execopts: 1)]
[Error matching program output for studies/ssca2/vass/SSCA2_main (compopts: 4, execopts: 1)]
[Error matching program output for studies/ssca2/vass/SSCA2_main (compopts: 5, execopts: 1)]

============================================================
Perf linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads
============================================================
Warnings from createGraphs should be eliminated because they are counted as errors.
Bug -> Vass.
Brad 6/22/2012: ''At some point I'd like someone to address it, but
since it isn't creating noise in the testing system (in the sense of
new emails that aren't worth paying attention to), I'd file it more in
the "once we've got the noise out, we should improve the system
itself" category.''
