bug: Default array alias created by slicing with a global domain results in an error

For DefaultRectangular, an alias created on locale!=0 by slicing with
a domain declared at the global scope results in an "attempt to
dereference nil" error message.

Not sure what is going on here, but declaring the domains within any
scope works (see the test program).
