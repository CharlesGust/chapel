bug: Global arrays declared with an initializing expression are not properly broadcast to other locales.

This is the same bug as test/domains/sungeun/multilocale/globalDomain.chpl.

When a global array variable is declared using an initializing
expression, the broadcast of the address on locale 0 is not done
properly.  Specifically, the broadcast call is made before the array
is fully initialized.

Workaround: Explicitly specify the type of the array.
