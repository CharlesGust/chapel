bug: program crashes when a variable of a tuple type is declared and one component of the tuple is an array

Currently I get this output when running the test:

nil
ChapelBase.chpl:1331: error: attempt to dereference nil

Here is what seems to happen. The array component of a tuple is
represented at runtime as a pointer to DefaultRectangularArr.  The
tuple variable (e.g. 'x1' in this example) gets NULL as the
corresponding default value.

Whenever almost *anything* is about to happen with that tuple
component, chpl__autoCopy() gets invoked on it. That tries
to increment its reference count. That means accessing an
instance variable off a NULL pointer, which crashes.

It seems like this happens during the initialization of that tuple
variable (e.g. 'x1').
