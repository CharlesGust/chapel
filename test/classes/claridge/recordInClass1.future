bug: memory corruption

Note: recordInClass1 and recordInClass2 are essentially the same.

Symptoms:
- recordInClass1 segfaults on Claridge's mac (when it was filed).
- recordInClass2 segfaults on lnx-vass and on chap10.
- recordInClass1 fails valgrind testing.
  recordInClass2 will most likely fail valgrind as well
  (it has been marked as a future so it has not been tested).

Triage: a chunk of memory is chpl_free'ed but is still referenced
(and modified) through another pointer. Valgrind points straight
to the C code and address where that modification happens.
It is the C representation of Chapel's 'c.r' that seems to get corrupted,
possibly during the call to writeln().
