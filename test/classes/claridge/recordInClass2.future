bug: Seg fault at runtime possibly due to improperly freeing memory.

recordInClass2 is the same as recordInClass1, but crashes
on lnx-vass and on chap10.

From Jonathan:

"This should produce a seg fault when it runs.  However, it appears that if you delete any of the characters in the writeln statement, then thereâ€™s no seg fault, and the program runs to completion.  As best I can tell, the seg fault depends on having 17 or more characters in the string.

Furthermore, if you remove the writeln statement altogether, the program will hang indefinitely."
