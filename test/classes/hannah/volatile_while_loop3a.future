semantic: blank intent for volatiles

This future asks whether the blank intent for volatiles should imply
pass-by-ref.  Rationale would be so that a callsite and callee could
share a single volatile variable.  Potential downside is that because
we coerce between non-volatiles and volatiles, it's not entirely clear
to me what would/should happen in the event of passing a normal
integer to a volatile formal.
