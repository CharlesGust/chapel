bug: Cannot call the constructor for a derived class when the base class has an explicit constructor.

Compiler-generated constructors have a meme field on the end, which is supposed
to be the not-yet-initialized object.  User-supplied constructors allocate the
needed memory and then fill in the fields.  We need to choose one style or the
other: Either the caller is responsible for allocating the memory or the callee
is.

For C-like construction, we want the caller to allocate memory.  This is more
efficient, but requires that we be able to calculate the size of an object at
compile time.  The representation of an object is "flat".  In the other option,
each constructor allocates its own idea of "this", and the representation of an
object with inherited fields has a hierarchical representation.  The latter
implementation is simpler, but less efficient.
