bug: Seg fault for simple case of inheritance.

This test declares a class A with a type variable (myType) and another
class B that is a subclass of A.  B has a function foo() that declares
a variable of type myType.

This test seg faults during the prune pass (during collect_asts),
similar to others in this directory.
