bug: Remote virtual method look up broken

This bug is a result of the int64 change.

We currently use an enum to index (cid) into the vmtable for dynamic
dispatch.  The int64 change declared the temps used to get the remote
index as an default int (64 bit), but the size of the enum is a 32-bit
value on most of our platforms (XMT is an exception).  The address of
the temporary and the cid field are passed to the communication
routines, and they are treated as pointers to 64 bit values.  So you
end up reading a 64 bit value from the address of something that is
only 32 bits.  In many cases in our testing, this doesn't seem to
matter because the extra bits are zero'ed out for some reason or
another.  But for SSCA2 and a number of aniruddha maddness tests, we
get a seg fault for multi-locale runs.
