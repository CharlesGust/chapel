error message: The compiler needs to generate a proper error message here.

Currently I get "error: unresolved call '_TypeDefaultT.writeThis(Writer)'".

If the writeln() line is removed, the generated C code has errors
(e.g. _TypeDefaultT is not defined).

The situation is the same for both classes, i.e. whether
it is a 'const' or a 'var' field.
