bug: a class's instantiated name in the generated code contains dot

The generated chpl__header.h has this:

typedef enum {
  ....,
  chpl__cid_B_1.0
} chpl__class_id;

The 'dot' clearly results from the generic param field
being instantiated with a real, which real's dot
(and probably any minus/plus(es) it may contain) need to be mangled.

Note that if it's a var/const field, the generic class
is instantiated with the 'real' type (rather than the specific value),
so the mangling omission does not come into play.
