feature request: assign (param) int domain to int64 domain

It seems like Chapel would be more orthogonal if one could
assign an int(32) domain to an int(64) domain without
casting, particularly if it is a param domain.  I suspect
that this is simply an overly constrained implementation
of the domain classes than anything deep.

Once this future is cleared up, a bunch of ugly casts
can be removed from SingleLocaleAssociative (feel free
to ping Brad to have him do the work).
