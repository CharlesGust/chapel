bug: domain equality uses promotion (plus semantic question too)

This test was written to ask the similar questions as
test/ranges/bradc/rangeEquality.chpl for domains.  However, it happens
to show that domain assignment is implemented today using a promoted
assignment on the index types rather than an actual set comparison
(which should be O(1) for rectangular domains; O(numIndices) for
sparse/associative domains with an O(1) escape if numIndices doesn't
match for the two.  If we were to fix the promotion issue but not
resolve the semantic question below, I'd convert this to a semantic
future as indicated in the header.  Giving credit where it's due: John
Lewis pointed this bug out recently as well.

As noted in the range version of the .future, my proposed answer for
the third comparison differs here from ranges because of the fact that
domains are intended to define index sets, so arguably we should be
using set equality rather than ordered equality.

I don't feel 100% confident of this final point.  In particular, I
could imagine an argument that says "rectangular domains are ordered
therefore we could/should take order into account in computing
equality" and I'm open to this argument.  This question is very
closely tied to the one asked in domainOrder.chpl in this same
directory.

Note that I only did 1D cases here to get the conversation started.
2D cases (or higher) should also be added as well as
associative/sparse cases.
