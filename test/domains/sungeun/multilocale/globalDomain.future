bug: Global domains declared using an initializing expression are not properly broadcast to other locales

When a global domain variable is declared using a domain literal or
other initializing expression, the broadcast of the address on locale
0 is not done properly.  Specifically, the broadcast call is made
before the domain is fully initialized.

Workaround: Explicitly specify the type of the domain.
