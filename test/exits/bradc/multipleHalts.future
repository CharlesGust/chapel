bug: when we hit a halt, we should only have one of the halts be processed

This test shows that if we hit a halt, we potentially have the same locale
process it multiple times.  This can cause the failure to join polling
thread message in GASNet.  I have a fix for this, but am currently planning
to commit it after the release unless there is a groundswell of popular
opinion to get it in.
