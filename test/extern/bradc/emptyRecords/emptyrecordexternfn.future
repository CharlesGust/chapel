bug: pruning of empty records and externs

This is similar to emptyexternrecord.chpl except in this case the
empty record is an internal Chapel type.  This is a little trickier
because here it seems reasonable to prune an internal Chapel type that
is determined to be empty, yet that means we have nothing left to pass
into the external function.
