error message: mark param value types

This error message is a placeholder for a problem J. Turner struggled
with at the beginning of the summer in which it appeared from the
current compiler output that resolution should be passing, but it was
not because a parameter value (like "10" in this example) was actually
a larger int than the function in question was calling for.  My
thought was that the error message could be clearer if the type of the
param value was indicated in the function call.  At the time I was
thinking this would be easy to do, but have never looked into it.
