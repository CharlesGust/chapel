bug: iterator causes unchecked nil dereference

This test is a minimized example of the bug currently (rev 17223) showing up in
the associative array dsiSorted() iterator. The bug only happens when some
optimizations are disabled. See the .compopts file for an example of some
options that exhibit the bug.
