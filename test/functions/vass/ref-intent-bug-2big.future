bug: compiler hits an internal failure in a certain case when 'ref' intent is used with comm=gasnet

This is the same as ref-intent-bug-1small.future, but with a larger program.
Right now I get:

ref-intent-bug-2big.chpl:111: error: unexpected case [parallel.cpp:567]

Works fine with comm=none.

When this bug is fixed, .skipif should be removed.
