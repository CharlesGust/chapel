bug: compiler hits an internal failure in a certain case when 'ref' intent is used with comm=gasnet

This is the same as ref-intent-bug-1small.future, but
* use integers instead of pointers, for clarity;
* test more variations (local vs. global variables).

When this bug is fixed, .skipif should be removed.
