The .good file for this test must be specified on a
machine-by-machine basis, as the test reports the
number of cores available on node 0 of the machine.

If anyone knows of a portable way to determine this
value from the command-line in a portable way (such
that we can tuck it into a prediff script and generate
the .good file on the fly), that would be very useful.
