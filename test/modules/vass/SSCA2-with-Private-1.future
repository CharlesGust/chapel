bug: a default class type constructor does not get resolved with certain 'use' decls

The case is extremely simple:

    module SSCA2_main {
      proc main () {
        use SSCA2_kernels;
      }
    }
    module SSCA2_kernels { 
      use PrivateDist;
    }

Currently I get:

    ChapelTaskTable.chpl:35: error: unresolved type specifier 'Private()'

(The location of the error can change with more complicated code,
but the message itself remains the same.)

Seems like there is some kind of ordering issue.
If 'use SSCA2_kernels' is moved (or copied) just outside main(),
things work fine.
