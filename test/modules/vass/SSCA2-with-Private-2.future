bug: a default class type constructor does not get resolved with certain 'use' decls

This is a variation on SSCA2-with-Private-1.chpl with slightly bigger
'use' tree.

It was intended to have the tree of 'use' statements directly a subset
of what's in test/release/examples/ssca2.  But there there are more
occurrences of the modules listed in SSCA2-with-Private-2.chpl.
