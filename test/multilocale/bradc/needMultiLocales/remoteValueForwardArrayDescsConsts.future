performance: remote value forwarding disabled for constants

Constants should be remote value forwarded even in the presence of
sync vars.  The reason this is harder to achieve than with array
descriptors is that it isn't just a function of the formal argument
type, but also of the const-ness of the actual.  But the compiler
does so many temp insertions and function calls between the original
const and the formal to be r.v.f'd that this is hard to tell.

My proposal is to move such constants (on primitives) off of the heap
in order to make remote value forwarding a correctness issue rather
than a performance issue.  We don't really want/need to put such
consts on the heap and pass them around by wide reference, so let's
hold ourselves to this.  I hope to take this on in the near future
(in my copious spare time ;).

Note that once this future is retired,
remoteValueForwardArrayDesc.chpl could be retired since it is the
prefix of this test.  I committed this way in order to log the future
while keeping the partial fix working.
