The reference version of EP for the largest size (size D) takes ~2,400 seconds
on a desktop machine.  For a good balance of reasonable comparison numbers 
versus performance tests taking too long, it would be optimal for Chapel's
version to be allowed to run for ~7,200 seconds.  However, that is over 2 hours.
As of revision 21580, we will run it with 1000 seconds and allow size D to time
out, even though it does complete if given enough time.
