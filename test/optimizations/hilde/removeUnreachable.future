bug: Unreachable generic code not removed.

If the type and param settings for a particular version of a generic function is
false, the compiler should remove code that is therefore unreachable.

To test this, I use the idiom

if ! param return a;
return b;

Note the lack of an else clause.  Presently, the compiler emits "return b;" even
when the param is false.  It should see that that statement is unreachable and
remove that from the generated code.
