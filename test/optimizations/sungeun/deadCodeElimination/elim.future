bug: Internal error in verify() after deadCodeElimination for some cases

Ran into the following internal error while debugging SSCA2 and pared
it down to this small test:

    error: SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but shift() has an "if true"
conditional with a return statement in the then portion.
