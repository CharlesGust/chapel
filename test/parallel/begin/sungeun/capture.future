feature request: Capture variable values used in a begin block at the
time of task creation.

Mostly just capturing a conversation we had with Fergie after his
Chapel class in 12/10.  This test case is very similar to the one he
sent to us.

A snippet:

  var i = 0;
  while i < n {
      begin work(i);
      i += 1;
    }

'i' is not private to the task, so each iteration does not necessarily
get a unique value of 'i' passed to work().

NOTE (12/2011): This test fails because i is passed by reference.
This *used* to make sense before the QIO changes because apparently
writeln() used to take its arguments by reference.  With the QIO
change, this test started passing since i is passed as a value to
writeln() and is no longer heap-allocated.  I added a barrier (with
sync and single vars) to the work() function, and for some reason, the
compiler decided to pass i by reference again.  So this test (and
captureAppearsToWork.chpl) again illustrates the issue described here,
but likely warrants a different future also for the pass by reference.

Brad suggested that the existence of task private variables could make
the situation better/clearer.

Evaluating some of the begin block at task creation time opens up a
bit of a can of worms because there is a question of where to draw the
line (how much should be evaluated?).

Another option might be to go the style of XMT futures where any
non-global variables that are used in the block are required to be
"passed in".  This might allow us to get rid of the heap allocation
step we have now during the parallel pass.

The solution should probably apply to cobegins also.
