// This test is intended to ensure that a warning message is emitted when the
// system is unable to create as many threads as requested.  (On most platforms,
// the default value of maxThreadsPerLocale is unbounded, but usually
// the system runs out of resources after two or three thousand
// threads have been created.)

// This test also makes sure that regardless of whether the system runs out of
// resources, tasks can be placed in the task pool, and these tasks are
// eventually performed to completion.
