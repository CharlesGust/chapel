bug: a newline in a string literal makes the parser's line counter 1 off

The error message about 'x' should point to Line 3 (where the declaration
actually occurs), but it currently points to Line 2 instead.
(What error message it is does not matter.)

It seems that's because the parser does not increment its line counter
upon the newline within the string argument to write().
