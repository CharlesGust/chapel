performance: enable fast-on for op= assignments

This test shows that the fast-on optimization does not fire for op=
assignments, though it does if this op= assignment is written out
longhand.  The reason for this is that op= assignments are implemented
with ref arguments, and in the current implementation, ref arguments
are always treated as wide, whether or not they need to be; and the
fast-on optimization is conservative around wide types because it
can't do communication within a fast-on.

The fix is to narrow reference arguments when possible and make the
analysis for op= under the fast-on optimization behave like normal
assignment in terms of considering the width of the RHS and LHS.
(the analysis in trunk/HEAD at the time of this writing is that
it conservatively always disables the optimization).

When this is fixed, the TODOs checked into DefaultRectangular with
this same commit should be found and 'a = a + b' idioms changed
back into 'a += b'.
