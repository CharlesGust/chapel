feature request: align operator

This feature request argues that if ranges are to store an alignment
(as suggested by other tests in this directory), then the user should
be able to change the alignment via an operator like "align" which
sets the new alignment.  I would say that the align operator should
take any value of range.idxType as its argument.  There's an open
question over whether the range would store the alignment (and print
it) in its raw value or as a value in the range 0..#abs(stride) --
i.e., in a somewhat normalized form.  The advantage of the normalized
form is that it would be less likely not to wrap around in the
presence of translate operators (for example).  The advantage of the
non-normalized form is that it is more consistent with what we do for
low/high values.  I think I'm currently leaning towards the
unnormalized form, which surprises me a little.

In this test, I've done obvious even/odd alignments as well as with
positive and negative values that are outside of the 0..#abs(stride)
range just to make sure that they work as well (and don't fall afoul
of C % operator weirness in the negative case).
