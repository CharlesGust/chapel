feature request: printing of aligned ranges

This future is intended to point out that if we support a general
alignment value and operator, we will need to make printing of ranges
print the alignment value.  My proposal here is that the alignment not
be printed in the case that it's trivially indicated by the
lower/upper bound based on the stride (i.e., if the lower bound is
aligned and the stride is positive, no alignment needs to be printed;
similarly, if the upper bound is aligned and it's negative).

Note that I've taken the approach here (debated in alignedOp.future)
of representing the alignment values in their non-normalized form.  If
we decide that ranges should store the alignment in a normalized form
(0..#abs(stride)) then the cases here that print "aligned 3" should
actually print "aligned 0".

The final case here shows that whereas today we normalize this range
into 1..9 by -2, the right behavior for a range that stores an
alignment value would probably be to leave the upper bound
un-normalized.
