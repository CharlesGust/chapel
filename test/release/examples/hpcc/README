Chapel HPC Challenge Codes
==========================

This directory contains Chapel versions of the HPC Challenge
benchmarks (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/) and a Makefile to help build
them.

These benchmarks are very much a work-in-progress and are provided to
give an indication of where we're going in Chapel.  The STREAM and RA
benchmarks are scalable but have outstanding performance and elegance
improvements that we have yet to address.  The FFT benchmark runs on
distributed memory, but does not yet scale or perform well.  The HPL
benchmark does not yet support distributed memory execution and has
performance issues on shared memory.  Our intention is to continue
improving the implementation of all of these benchmarks over time.
Please refer to the Chapel website (http://chapel.cray.com) for
reports that evaluate these benchmarks over time.

The main files for these benchmarks are as follows:

     stream.chpl            : the global STREAM Triad benchmark
     stream-ep.chpl         : the EP STREAM Triad benchmark
     ra.chpl                : the global Random Access benchmark
     fft.chpl               : the global 1D FFT benchmark
     hpl.chpl               : the High Performance Linpack benchmark

There are also helper modules for these benchmarks:

     HPCCProblemSize.chpl   : a common module for computing problem sizes
     RARandomStream.chpl    : the random stream generator for ra.chpl

These benchmarks can be compiled using the following commands:

     chpl --fast -o stream stream.chpl
     chpl --fast -o stream-ep stream-ep.chpl
     chpl --fast -o ra ra.chpl
     chpl --fast -o fft fft.chpl
     chpl --fast -o hpl hpl.chpl

The presence of the --fast flag turns
on optimizations, turns off runtime correctness checks, and permits
IEEE math to be relaxed for some back-end C compilers).  

Or using the provided Makefile you can make the tests individually
using:

    gmake stream
    gmake stream-ep
    gmake ra
    gmake fft
    gmake hpl

Or to make them all, use:

    gmake all
