Chapel HPC Challenge Codes
==========================

This directory contains Chapel versions of the HPC Challenge
benchmarks (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/) and a Makefile to help build
them.  For a detailed explanation of these benchmarks, please visit
the Chapel web site at http://chapel.cray.com.

The main files for these benchmarks are as follows:

     stream.chpl            : the global STREAM Triad benchmark
     stream-ep.chpl         : the EP STREAM Triad benchmark
     ra.chpl                : the global Random Access benchmark
     fft.chpl               : the global 1D FFT benchmark
     hpl.chpl               : the High Performance Linpack benchmark

There are also helper modules for these benchmarks:

     HPCCProblemSize.chpl   : a common module for computing problem sizes
     RARandomStream.chpl    : the random stream generator for ra.chpl

These benchmarks can be compiled using the following commands:

     chpl -o stream stream.chpl
     chpl -o stream-ep stream-ep.chpl
     chpl -o ra ra.chpl
     chpl -o fft fft.chpl
     chpl -o hpl hpl.chpl

Or using the provided Makefile (which also turns on optimizations,
turns off runtime correctness checks, and permits IEEE math to be
relaxed with some back-end C compilers).  To make the tests
individually use:

    gmake stream
    gmake stream-ep
    gmake ra
    gmake fft
    gmake hpl

To make them all, use:

    gmake all
