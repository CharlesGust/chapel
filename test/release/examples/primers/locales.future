Bug: RVF is too aggressive when .locale.id is used.

Introduced on the caseyb branch.

Rework of the representation of locale IDs means that only wide have a locale ID associated with them.
Narrow pointers have the locale ID returned by here.

When RVF is applied, it extracts the value pointed to by a wide pointer and passes that along.
So the new localeID macro sees that the forwarded value is just a value, and returns here() rather than 
the localeID of the locale in which the original object is allocated.

To reproduce, use gasnet and NUMLOCALES >= 2.

To show that RVF is at fault, repeat the test with --no-remote-value-forwarding.
