Chapel HPC Challenge Codes
==========================

This directory contains Chapel versions of three HPC Challenge
benchmarks (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/) and a Makefile to help build
them.  These codes were the basis for our 2008 HPC Challenge
submission for class 2 ("most productivity").  For a detailed
explanation of these benchmarks, please refer to the hpccOverview.pdf
and hpccTutorial.pdf papers in the doc/ directory.

The main files for these benchmarks are as follows:

     stream.chpl            : the STREAM Triad benchmark
     ra.chpl                : the global Random Access benchmark
     fft.chpl               : the global 1D FFT benchmark
     hpl.chpl               : the High Performance Linpack benchmark

There are also helper modules for these benchmarks:

     probSize.chpl          : a common module for computing problem sizes
     ra-randstream.chpl     : the random stream generator for ra.chpl

These benchmarks can be compiled using the following commands:

     chpl -o stream probSize.chpl stream.chpl
     chpl -o ra probSize.chpl ra-randstream.chpl ra.chpl
     chpl -o fft probSize.chpl fft.chpl
     chpl -o hpl probSize.chpl hpl.chpl

Or using the provided Makefile (which also turns on optimizations,
turns off runtime correctness checks, and permits IEEE math to be
relaxed with some back-end C compilers).  To make the tests
individually use:

    gmake stream
    gmake ra
    gmake fft
    gmake hpl

To make them all, use:

    gmake all
