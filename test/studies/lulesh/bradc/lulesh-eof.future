bug: assertion of EOF idiom doesn't work consistently

In our LULESH code, we had a few bugs in our IO routines that would
have been easier to catch if we had checked that we were at EOF when
we were done reading.  This code shows how I attempted to approach
this idiom, which works with some input files
(../lmeshes/sedov2cube.lmesh and ../lmeshes/sedov45cube.lmesh) but not
with others (all others in ../lmeshes at the time of this writing).
Not sure why this is... maybe related to buffering/readahead issues
that might vary depending on precise file size?

Anyway, this future locks in a case that consistently doesn't work for
me in hopes that Michael can look into it.  Once it's working, this
test can be retired and the commented-out EOF test in lulesh.chpl can
be used to lock in the same behavior.
