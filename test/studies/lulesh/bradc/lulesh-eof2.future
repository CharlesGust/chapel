feature request: assertEOF

This feature request asks for (reading) channels to have an assertEOF
method (or equivalent) as a means of easily having a sanity check that
one has read an entire file's contents (modulo whitespace?).  While
writing one of these manually isn't too hard (modulo the bug in
lulesh-eof.chpl), I'd be more likely to use it and write safe code if
it was a built-in capability.

Once this capability exists, this test can be retired and it can be
put to use in lulesh.chpl in this same directory (though other tests
should be added to lock in the failure of the assertion, etc.)

It occurs to me as I write this that perhaps instead (or in addition),
we may want variations that do not themselves trip an assertion error
so that the user can choose to print out their own useful error or
halt message instead of getting a fairly generic assertion failure.
