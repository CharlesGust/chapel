semantic: what should main's return type be?

Current implementation mostly assumes void; returning an int makes it
through the compiler, but chokes in runtime.  We should enforce a
specific type -- either void (in which case, returning from main
should not be allowed), or int (in which case we should add a return 0
to the end of any user-defined main function, as well as any that we
create).
