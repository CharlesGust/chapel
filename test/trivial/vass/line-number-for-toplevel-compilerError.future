bug: the error message for compilerError points to a wrong line number

It should point to Line 4, where the compilerError call is actually
located, but at present it points to Line 1.

It probably has something to do with how the call stack is processed
upon a compilerError/compilerWarning (e.g. in issueCompilerError()).
