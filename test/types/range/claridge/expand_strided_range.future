bug: expanding a strided range may yield un-aligned bounds

The same problem occurs using range.interior or range.exterior.
I think this is a higher-level incident of the same issue in
strided_range_constructor.chpl -- the bound-alignment only occurs
when "by" is called, but "by" is never called if the range
constructor is used directly.

The main difference is you can get to an endless loop by a way
that's meant to be user-exposed.  (Also, Brad asked for a .future for
this one, and who am I to deny Brad what he wants?)
