bug: Integer constant arithmetic should use 64-bits.

Integer literal expressions with no specified type should use 64-bit arithmetic
by default.  This can be done even if the default type for the expression as a
whole is int32.  Then, if the compile-time value does not fit, we can issue a
warning.

In this particular test case, the version of align should expect a 64-bit
alignment value, so the correct alignment is 32768 mod 10 == 8, as shown in the
.good file.
