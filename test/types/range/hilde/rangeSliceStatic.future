feature request: Warn on range slicing an integer (literal syntax is confusing)

With 1..6 [3..] we get:

rangeSliceStatic.chpl:8: error: unresolved access of 'int' by '[range(int,boundedLow,0)]'

and that is all.

This is probably a more general bug involving the semantics of the static function-call syntax, and not specific to range slicing --
though perhaps related to the fact that range defines an overloaded 'this' function.

**********

This turns out to be expected behavior.  The indexing operators () []
bind more tightly than than the range literal operator, so the
expression is parsed as 1..(6[3..]), and there is no operator
int[range].  The best we can do here is to give a better error
message (or change the operator precedence which is arguable
undesirable).
