bug: Range slicing using the statically-type procedure-call syntax does not work.

Instead, we get:
rangeSliceStatic.chpl:8: error: unresolved access of 'int' by '[range(int,boundedLow,0)]'

and that is all.

This is probably a more general bug involving the semantics of the static function-call syntax, and not specific to range slicing --
though perhaps related to the fact that range defines an overloaded 'this' function.
