bug: We do not call the destructor for a global record that is of wide type.

I think we just don't clean up after any wide heap allocated types.  This
should be fixed in insertGlobalAutoDestroyCalls() in callDestructors.cpp.

This passes normal comm none testing but not when using the --no-local flag.
