bug: Failed assertion in replaceLocalsWithField() for tuple of tuples.

This is a simplified version of a function that Brandon Holt wrote for
his Lulesh code.  It appears that the tuple of tuple causes the
following assertion:

            INT_ASSERT(tmp->type->refType);

The refType is NULL because the type itself is a reference.

Brandon replace the the tuple of tuples with a 2D array as a workaround.
