feature request: provide an equality operator on domains (==)

Right now we get these errors:

domain-equality-operator-1.chpl:6: error: cannot promote short-circuiting && operator
domain-equality-operator-1.chpl:7: error: iterator or promoted expression used in if or while condition

Note: apparently '==' is already provided on ranges. If so,
it should be documented in the spec.
