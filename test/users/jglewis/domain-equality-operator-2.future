bug: "error: unable to resolve return type" when asserting equality on domains

Right now we get:

domain-equality-operator-2.chpl:14: error: unable to resolve return type

It is unclear whether this is due to the == equality getting promoted
over the domains (then, see domain-equality-operator-1.*) or due to
some bug in the compiler.
