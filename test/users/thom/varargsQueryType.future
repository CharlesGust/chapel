feature request: querying a (uniform) varargs type

It seems reasonable to permit the type of a homogeneous
varargs argument list to be queried as we do for other
argument types.

Note that varargs arguments with a specified element
type don't seem to be described (well?) in the spec.
At least I couldn't find it with a quick scan of
examples and the varargs section.
