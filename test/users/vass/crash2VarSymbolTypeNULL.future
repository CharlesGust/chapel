bug: compiler crashes with internal failure VarSymbol::type is NULL [symbol.cpp:168]

I did not investigate.
The crashes seem to have started after I added 'seena' and related code.
It is quite likely that these tests can be trimmed down to very small sizes.

This crash is not observed with comm=none without --no-local.
