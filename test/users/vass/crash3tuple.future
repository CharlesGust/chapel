bug: compiler crashes with INT_ASSERT in iterator.cpp:120

It crashes 'call' points to 'lls.x2' (aka "lls(2)") at crash3tuple.chpl:758.
tmp is: _tmp[1426393]:_ref(2*int)[531142]
tmp->type is: _ref(2*int)[531139]
              aka (531141 DefExpr '_val[531140]:2*int[531097]')
tmp->type->refType is null (which, of course, causes the INT_ASSERT)

I did not investigate further.
May well be reflected by other futures.
