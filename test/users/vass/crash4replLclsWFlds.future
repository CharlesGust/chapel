bug: compiler crashes with an assertion in replaceLocalsWithFields()

I get this:

error: assertion error [iterator.cpp:120]

while processing myDims(dd) in crash4replLclsWFlds.chpl:815.

Note: the assertion goes away if I pass 'myDims(dd)' as an (additional)
argument to iter1dCheck().

I have not investigated or trimmed the code to a smaller test case.
