bug: name clash of global variables in the generated code with mathcalls.h

Currently I get these during from the C compiler:

chpl__header.h:1574: error: ‘drem’ redeclared as different kind of symbol
/usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h:208: error: previous declaration of ‘drem’ was here

etc.

The conflicts come from #include <math.h> in runtime headers.
We should look through the documentation for math.h for a complete list
of names to avoid in the generated code.
