bug: arrays with negative stride don't work

I've taken my best guess as to what ought to happen with this test,
although I could also imagine the second and third lines being swapped
potentially (the question being whether an array over a negative
stride affects the order in which its writeln'd).  In any case, the
compiler doesn't do anything useful with it at present.
