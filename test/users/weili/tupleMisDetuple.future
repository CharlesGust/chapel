bug: de-tupling permits size mismatch

Our current de-tupling implementation seems to permit size mismatches
which in one case cause elements to be dropped on the floor and in
another cases causes an out-of-bounds indexing error.  This is
somewhat similar to the onetuple-error.chpl test I filed earlier
today.
