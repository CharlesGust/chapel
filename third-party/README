Chapel third-party directory
============================

This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:

dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) which we use to
           support malloc/free calls when running GASNet programs
           using segment fast.

  License: dlmalloc has been placed in the public domain as explained
           at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain

  See also: the comments in dlmalloc/src/dlmalloc.c


gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

  License: GASNet is made available under a BSD-style license, which
           can be found in gasnet/GASNet-<version>/license.txt

nanox/
  Summary: the Nanos++ user-level tasking library being developed by
           Barcelona Supercompting Center (BSC).  We are working on
           using this as a lighter-weight tasking alternative to
           pthreads.

qthread/ 
  Summary: the Qthreads user-level tasking package being developed by
           Sandia National Laboratory.  We are working on using this
           as a lighter-weight tasking alternative to pthreads.

  License: Qthreads is released under the New BSD License, which can
           be found in qthread/qthread-<version>/COPYING
