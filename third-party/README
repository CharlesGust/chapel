Chapel third-party directory
============================

This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:

dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) which we use to
           support malloc/free calls when running GASNet programs
           using segment fast.

  License: dlmalloc has been placed in the public domain as explained
           at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain

gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

           can be found in gasnet/GASNet-<version>/license.txt

pvm/
  Summary: the PVM message passing library that we are using to
           prototype hybrid (multi-realm) Chapel execution

  License: an ORNL variant off the BSD license (see the top of
           pvm/pvm-*/pvm3/Readme for example)

qthread/
  Summary: the qthreads user-level tasking package.  We are working on
           using this to provide a lighter-weight tasking alternative
           to pthreads.
