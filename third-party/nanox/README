Nanos++ README for Chapel
=========================

This version of Nanos++ came from the git sourcetree with git ID
e3a0ce4913df42c2e4bbd291ae26f51c307f49df (e3a0ce4 for short).  It is a
snapshot that fell chronologically after official release 0.5 but
before 0.6 was ready due to differences in our release timing.  It was
cleared for use in this release by Alejandro Duran of the Nanos++ team
at Barcelona Supercomputing Center.
