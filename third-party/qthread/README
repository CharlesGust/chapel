Qthreads README for Chapel
==========================

This copy of Qthreads is being released with Chapel for convenience
and uses a snapshot of obtained from the Qthreads team at:

  https://code.google.com/p/qthreads/downloads/list

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to Qthreads should be
directed to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net.

The local modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads 1.7
release are as follows:

* modified the implementation of the serial state to support calls to
  get/setSerial prior to initialization.  This corresponds to commit
  r2444 to the Qthreads tree (made after the 1.7 release).

* applied a fix for autoconf scripts in a cross-compilation
  environment.  This corresponds to commit r2590 to the Qthreads tree
  (made after the 1.7 release).

* added config/ac_prog_sed.m4 which was intended to be in the 1.7
  release, but mistakenly left out.  This permits autogen.sh to be run
  without problems if needed.

* added the --force flag to the autoreconf call in autogen.sh because
  the timestamps aren't particularly trustworthy once we've committed
  things to SVN and checked them back out again.

* applied a patch supplied by Dylan Stark reflecting changes made to
  the Qthreads sources recently to support compatibility with Chapel's
  new QIO features by supporting a sentinel value for
  chpl_task_getId() in the event that it is called outside of a task
  -- for example, by the main() program thread prior to starting up
  tasks.
