==========================

This copy of Qthreads is being released with Chapel for convenience
and uses a snapshot of obtained from the Qthreads team at:

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to Qthreads should be
directed to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net.

The local modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads 1.7
release are as follows:

* modified the implementation of the serial state to support calls to
  get/setSerial prior to initialization.  This corresponds to commit
  r2444 to the Qthreads tree (made after the 1.7 release).
