SOCL is an extension that aims at implementing the OpenCL standard on
top of StarPU. It allows to gives a (relatively) clean and
standardized API to StarPU.
By allowing OpenCL applications to use StarPU transparently, it
provides users with the latest StarPU enhancements without any further
development, and allows these OpenCL applications to easily fall back
to another OpenCL implementation.

This section does not require detailed knowledge of the StarPU
library.

Note: as of StarPU @value{VERSION}, this is still an area under
development and subject to change.
